### E2E Testing with Playwright (BDD)

Apart from the current E2E-Testing approach, there will be another approach managed from now on that uses **Playwright BDD** (Behaviour-Driven-Development).
The new approach provides a more simplified understanding on what is executed in each test.
More on that can be found inside [Playwright README](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/hyades/blob/master/e2e/playwright-tests/README.md)

*V1 will be managed inside the Hyades repository. 
The next version will be decoupled into its own repository, abstracting it from Hyades entirely and also allowing for DTrackV4 (aka the Monolith) to be tested.*
